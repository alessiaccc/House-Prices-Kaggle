In this repository I shared a university project I made. The goal was to predict house prices following the challenge "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" on Kaggle using PySpark, with an accurate data preprocessing.

Here you can find the challenge and download data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

I uploaded a notebook file named 'house_prices.ipynb' with the complete work explained in detail. 

The work is divided into 5 parts as follows:

1. Introduction
   
   1.1 Our goal
   
   1.2 Configuration of the environment and data import
   
2. 'SalePrice' analysis
   
3. Data preprocessing

   3.1 Missing values management
   
   3.2 Outliers management

   3.3 Features selection
   
4. Building of the training pipeline

    4.1 Preliminary stage: string indexers and one-hot encoders

    4.2 Loss function

    4.3 Linear Regression

    4.4 Random Forest

    4.5 Gradient boosting
   
6. Models comparison and conclusions
